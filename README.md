# Educational AI Project

## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to create an educational AI that serves as a compromise between students and teachers in the context of AI-assisted learning. The AI will provide answers and suggestions in a way that encourages students to think independently and learn effectively, rather than simply cheating.

### Key Features

- **Balanced Assistance**: The AI will offer help without giving away complete answers, ensuring students engage with the material.
- **Data Storage**: All data exchanged through the application will be stored in database files for tracking and analysis.
- **Custom Systems for School Districts**: Similar to how EPIC customizes medical systems, this AI will be tailored to meet the specific needs of different school districts.
- **Enhanced Learning Experience**: The primary objective is to create a better learning environment where students can learn effectively and teachers can be confident that students are not cheating.

### Goals

- Improve the learning experience for students.
- Reduce concerns about cheating among teachers.
- Provide a customizable solution for different educational institutions.
